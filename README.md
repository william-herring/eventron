<p>
Eventron has been built as a social platform for engaging in virtual and in-person events. It aims to centralize the event management software industry, to provide consumers with a go-to option for event organisation and discovery. In this first prototype, the focus has been on making events easy to create, discover and join. Eventron is community-driven; meaning that an event's discoverability is linked to what community category it is under. Users can join communities to discover events matching their interests. Communities are decided by Eventron administrators, and can be adjusted if their is enough support for new communities. Suggested communities are:
<ul>
    <li>General</li>
    <li>Sports</li>
    <li>Meet-and-Greets</li>
    <li>Conventions and Exhibits</li>
    <li>Festivals</li>
    <li>Competitions</li>
</ul>
